# ColorShift

A “program that makes each pixel in an image a unique color,” written by
[/u/RedHotChiliRocket][1] on Reddit.

Inspired by [a CodeGolf.SE post for images with all colors][2].

[Post on /r/glitch_art, with discussion][3]

# This is the development branch

I’m modifying the original code to

1. Port it to Python 3
2. Make it more readable and introduce a better public interface
3. Make it faster (maybe)

# Dependencies

ColorShift requires (at least) [Pillow][4] (`pip install Pillow` or whatever).
