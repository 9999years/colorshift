# ColorShift

A “program that makes each pixel in an image a unique color,” written by
[/u/RedHotChiliRocket][1] on Reddit.

I’m still sorting through the code (and porting it to Python 3!) — I’ll update
this as I figure more of it out, though.

`Colorator.py` is the file to run, though.

Requires [PIL][4], which implies no Python 3 support (oh no).

Inspired by [a CodeGolf.SE post for images with all colors][2].
